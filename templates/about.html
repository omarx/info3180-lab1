    <h1>Omar Peart</h1>
    <p>Originating from the vibrant city of Kingston, Jamaica, I am a 27-year-old innovative web developer. My foundation in this field is cemented by a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, supplemented by a Minor in Economics, both of which I earned from the prestigious University of the West Indies. Presently, I specialize in full stack and mobile development, exhibiting proficiency in multiple programming languages including Java, Javascript, and Python. My holistic understanding of technology coupled with a passion for creative problem-solving drives my commitment towards designing and developing seamless, user-centric digital solutions.</p>
